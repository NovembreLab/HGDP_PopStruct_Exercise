# HGDP_PopStruct_Exercise

A computer lab exercise that introduces students to SNP data while exploring topics related to population structure. 

The document that explains the lab is PopGenWorkshop.pdf, which is also available as an Rmarkdown file. It contains a 
narrative walking the user through the data analysis with questions and an answer key at the end.
