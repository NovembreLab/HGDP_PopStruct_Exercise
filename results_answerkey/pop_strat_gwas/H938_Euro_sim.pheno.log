Reading map (extended format) from [ ../data/H938_Euro.bim ] 
659276 markers to be included from [ ../data/H938_Euro.bim ]
Reading pedigree information from [ ../data/H938_Euro.fam ] 
124 individuals read from [ ../data/H938_Euro.fam ] 
0 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
0 cases, 0 controls and 124 missing
65 males, 59 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Reading genotype bitfile from [ ../data/H938_Euro.bed ] 
Detected that binary PED file is v1.00 SNP-major mode
Reading alternate phenotype from [ pheno.sim.txt ] 
124 individuals with non-missing alternate phenotype
Assuming a quantitative trait
Missing phenotype value is -9
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 659276 SNPs
124 founders and 0 non-founders found
52 heterozygous haploid genotypes; set to missing
Writing list of heterozygous haploid genotypes to [ H938_Euro_sim.pheno.hh ]
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 0.99911
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 659276 SNPs
After filtering, 124 individuals with non-missing status
After filtering, 65 males, 59 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
