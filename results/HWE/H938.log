	--out H938

Reading map (extended format) from [ ../../data/H938.bim ] 
659276 markers to be included from [ ../../data/H938.bim ]
Scan region on chromosome 2 from [ rs4637157 ] to [ rs12469535 ]
Reading pedigree information from [ ../../data/H938.fam ] 
938 individuals read from [ ../../data/H938.fam ] 
0 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
0 cases, 0 controls and 938 missing
615 males, 323 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Reading genotype bitfile from [ ../../data/H938.bed ] 
Detected that binary PED file is v1.00 SNP-major mode
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 53652 SNPs
938 founders and 0 non-founders found
Writing Hardy-Weinberg tests (founders-only) to [ H938.hwe ] 
22220 markers to be excluded based on HWE test ( p <= 0.001 )
	0 markers failed HWE test in cases
	0 markers failed HWE test in controls
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 0.999328
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 31432 SNPs
After filtering, 0 cases, 0 controls and 938 missing
After filtering, 615 males, 323 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
